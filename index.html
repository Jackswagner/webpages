		<p>Hey! My name's <strong>Nahom Habtemariam</strong>. I'm 17 years old and an undergraduate freshman(2025) at North Carolina State University.
			I'm actually from connecticut and decided to go here due to the <ins>computer science</ins> major's golden
			opportunities(which is the major I am in, and the major I <em>deeply</em> love). I also love warmer weather, the outdoors, and adventure 
			which is also why I came here.</p>    
		<br />
		<p style="font-family: Playfair Display; font-weight: bold;">My dream job is to be hired as a Software Engineer/Developer at high-end technological companies like
			Apple, Amazon, Qualcomm, Origin, Samsung, etc. In order to reach this goal, I hope to reach this
			goal by firstly taking initiative and growing my repitiore by creating and managing many projects. 
			I also intended to intern during my sophomore and junior year for the hope of making it to a full-time
			job preferably first at a tech-startup where I can learn as the company grows.</p>
