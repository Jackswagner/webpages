		<p>Hey, my name is <strong>Jack Wagner</strong> and I am a first year student majoring in <ins>biological and agricultural engineering</ins>. 
		I choose this major for two reasons, first I am <em>very</em> interested in both biology and mathematics and thought this would be a good combonation of the two. 
		Secondly, I became fascinated by genetics in a paper I wrote in highschool and thought this would be a good rought to possibly transfer to that major down the line.

		<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px; color:#140e78 text-align: center">A job I currently have is working as a host and server at a resteraunt in my home town. 
		As a host, I work the front desk, seating people as they come in, answering the phone, and making sure that customers are happy. As a server, I take 
		peoples orders, bring their food, make sure they are having the best night they can have.</p>
